# Laravel Breadcrumbs

The Laravel Breadcrumbs package enables developers to easily integrate breadcrumb trails into their [Laravel](https://laravel.com) applications.

This package is a continuation of the [`davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs`](https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs) package.

Once installed, you can quickly define the breadcrumb trails for the different sections of your application and render them in your views, with full control over the rendered layout.
